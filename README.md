## Repository design

Our default branch is called `main`. Here, you can always find the latest features. This branch should always be buildable using Flutter's `dev` channel.

Aside, we still have the `stable` branch. Wekk, it's *stable*. The code is hence tested and ysyally up to date with the released Apps un the stores. All tags should be taken from the `stable` branch.

All other branches are potentially unsatble and commonly not buildable. Here, we play around with new features and ideas.
